Building A View

| CRITERIA                                                     | MEETS SPECIFICATIONS                                         |
| :----------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Write a `CREATE` statement that results in creation of a View | The create a **forestation** view query that the student writes prior to answering the questions joins all three tables on the columns indicated, and creates a new column by performing a calculation that compares two columns. |

Basic SQL Queries

| CRITERIA                                                     | MEETS SPECIFICATIONS                                         |
| :----------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Write SQL queries that execute properly.                     | Each query is included in the Appendix and executes properly. A reviewer should be able to execute this same query and get the correct output. |
| Write SQL queries that make use of the `SELECT` keyword to return information from provided tables | `SELECT` queries return results consistent with the question being asked. |
| Write queries that filter resulting tables using the `WHERE` keyword. | `WHERE` clauses used in `SELECT` statements filter tables according to the questions being asked |
| Write queries that sort resulting tables using `ORDER BY` keyword | `ORDER BY` clauses used in `SELECT` statements sort query results according to the questions being asked, and specify ASC for ascending or DESC for descending where appropriate |
| Write queries that aggregate data using the `GROUP BY` keyword | `GROUP BY` clauses aggregate results by chosen categorical variables |
| Write queries that contain `BOOLEAN OPERATORS` to compare values in the tables | Queries make use of operators such as =, < and/or > to qualify `WHERE` clauses and `JOIN` statements, as well as conditions AND and OR to link conditional clauses. |

Windows Functions

| CRITERIA                                              | MEETS SPECIFICATIONS                                         |
| :---------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Write SQL queries that makes use of Windows functions | Queries make use of Windows Functions such as SUM, COUNT, ROUND and/or ABS as needed to perform the appropriate calculation in order to answer the questions posed. |

Join Command

| CRITERIA                                                     | MEETS SPECIFICATIONS                                         |
| :----------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| The project contains properly formatted SQL Joins            | Queries include the appropriate form of Join (Inner, Left, Right, Outer) clause to ensure that no necessary rows are left out. |
| The project contains a `JOIN` that combines disparate tables together on one or multiple columns | Queries include Join clauses that match appropriate columns together using the ON command and the appropriate Boolean operator. |
| The project uses a `JOIN` to perform row-level calculations on a single table like difference and percent difference. | The student creates a query that joins a table to itself in order to compare values in two different rows. |

Case Command

| CRITERIA                                                     | MEETS SPECIFICATIONS                                         |
| :----------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Write a `CASE` statement to return values based on specific conditions | The query the student writes for question 3(c) includes a `CASE` statement that addresses the question. |

Report Formatting

| CRITERIA                                                  | MEETS SPECIFICATIONS                                         |
