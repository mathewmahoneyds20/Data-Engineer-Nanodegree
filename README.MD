# Data-Engineer-Nanodegree

## 1.Welcome to the Nanodegree Program!

**What it Takes**
Completing a Udacity program takes perseverance and dedication, but the rewards outweigh the challenges. Throughout your program, you will develop and demonstrate specific skills that will serve you for a lifetime. Congratulations on taking the first step towards developing the skills you need to power your career through tech education!

The videos, text lessons, and quizzes you encounter in the classroom are optional but recommended. The project at the end of this course will test your ability to apply the skills and strategies you have learned in the classroom to real-world problems. It will also provide tangible outputs you can use to demonstrate your skills for current and future employers.

The project is designed to be challenging. Many students initially struggle, but with a little grit, they are able to learn from their mistakes and build their skills. Data from nearly 100,000 Udacity graduates show that commitment and persistence are the highest predictors of whether or not a student will graduate.

At some point, nearly every student will get stuck on a new concept or skill, and doubt may set in. Don’t panic. Don’t quit. Be patient, and work through the problem. Remember that you are not alone and the problem that you are encountering is likely one that many others have experienced as well. Whether you are stuck or simply looking for encouragement, you’ll find Udacity Mentors and students there to help.

## **2. Introduction to SQL**

#### <u>PROJECT: Deforestation Exploration</u>

##### A PDF report using a dataset with global deforestation dataincluding land size and land allotted to forestry broken down by country.

###### I used SQL to complete the report based on the template provided and the results although sad not suprising with how poorly our forest and trees are treated.

##### Subjects Covered: 

GLOBAL SITUATION

REGIONAL OUTLOOK

COUNTRY-LEVEL DETAIL

## 4. MANAGEMENT OF  RELATIONAL AND NON-RELATIONAL DATABASES

#### <u>PROJECT: Udiddit, A Social News Aggregator</u>

This project showcased a full schema created from scratch and database management skills by answering questions and interpreting the answer into SQL queries.  This was the most time-consuming of all the projects as the details were very specific and so many parts of the project related to accurate queries and code in other parts.  In the end, everything was created correctly and the data was filled in the schema successfully.  Please take a read below.

## 5. PREPARING AND MODELING DATA WITH POWER BI

#### <u>PROJECT: Create a data model for the Seven Sages Brewing Company</u>

Using real sales information from a brewing company the task was to create a sales visual matrix based on several specific requested aggregations that the stakeholder desired.  In addition to creating measures using Dax and power query, the data included some transactions in a different currency since some of the companies were located in Canada.  Which meant there had to be some currency exchange calculations along with the data to get the correct information in the end.

## 6. CREATING VISUALIZATIONS WITH POWER BI

#### <u>PROJECT: Building a PowerBI report for Waggle</u>

Waggle is a company that sells devices that monitor activity and health information for either a cat or dog.  It's basically a Fitbit for your pet.  For this project, the stakeholder wanted 3 specific pages, one based on their pet data and creating insights based on that data.  Another page was based on the family and customer data collected and then the main page was to answer two important questions to give insight into the company's product and activity from cats and dogs separately.    This was a fully interactive presentation, with buttons, bookmarks, and multiple graph variations along with a full assortment of search metrics that a user could enter to get more specific data visuals.
